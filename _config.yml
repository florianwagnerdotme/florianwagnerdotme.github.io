# 60 Words About the Author
author-about: Dear friend, my name is Florian Wagner. As a solopreneur I founded my own Cyber Security Company, was Project Security Manager and am now working as an Ethical Hacker. My experiences range from penetration testing of government applications over managing the security of big projects like the German Corona Warn App (CWA) and its European Federation Gateway Service (EFGS) to partaking in the IDM security standardization of projects within the GSMA. Currently I am on the road to fine tune my hacking skills by developing own projects, working together with the hacker community and my team at work and doing CTFs as well as bug bounties.  Let us gladly connect and have a chat! üëáüëáüëá
