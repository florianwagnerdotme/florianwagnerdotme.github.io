### About the tutor:
Good day, my name is Florian Wagner and I am a passionate white hat hacker and IT security expert. 
Besides being an ethical hacker, IT security expert and CEO of my cyber security company, I love teaching and sharing what I know.  
Previously, I worked for several years at a German telecom provider in which I performed web and mobile security penetration tests for different clients. I also managed large projects like the Corona Warn App, the European Federation Gateway Service (EFGS) and Mobile Connect (GSMA) as a project security manager. Thus, I can now look back on 6 years of security experience. Furthermore, I am a Certified Cyber Security Professional (IHK). 
My mission is to provide frameworks, tools and services to improve the information security of companies and people around the world.
