title: Florian Wagner - Vulnerability Disclosure Policy
layout: page
---

I, Florian Wagner, an independent security researcher, am dedicated to working closely with the open-source community and projects affected by vulnerabilities to protect users and ensure coordinated disclosure. When identifying a vulnerability, I follow a responsible disclosure process:

1. **Notification:**
    - I will report the vulnerability by contacting the publicly-listed security contact for the project, if available. If not, I will attempt to contact the project maintainers directly.

2. **Collaboration:**
    - If the project team responds and acknowledges the security risk, I will collaborate with them to communicate the vulnerability details and agree on the process for public disclosure.

3. **Responsibility:**
    - The responsibility for developing and releasing a patch lies with the project team. I aim to assist by providing detailed information about the vulnerability.

4. **Disclosure Deadline:**
    - My disclosure deadline for publicly disclosing a vulnerability is 90 days after the first report to the project team.

5. **Flexibility:**
    - I acknowledge the hard work maintainers invest in fixing vulnerabilities, and I understand that additional time may be necessary. I am open to discussing my disclosure policy to accommodate specific requirements when warranted.

I believe in fostering a collaborative and responsible security community to enhance the overall safety of projects and their users. I am committed to ethical and transparent practices in vulnerability disclosure.

For inquiries or to report a vulnerability, contact me, Florian Wagner, at [mail[at]florianwagner.me](mailto:mail@florianwagner.me).

This disclosure policy is based on [GitHub Security Lab](https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/#policy)'s disclosure policy.
