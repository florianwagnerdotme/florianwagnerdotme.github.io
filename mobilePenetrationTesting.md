A **Mobile Penetration Test** is a security evaluation of an iOS or Android app by an Ethical Hacker. The goal of this attack emulation is to find weak implementations or sensitive information that could be misused by an attacker in a harmful manner. Without or with insider knowledge our Penetration Tester will use static and dynamic analysis to identify vulnerabilities in the mobile application. Based on the current OWASP Mobile Top 10 vulnerabilities and common and advanced mobile application attacks a security assessment will uncover the weaknesses and attack vectors of the mobile application. In addition to analyzing the mobile application the Security Evaluation can be extended to the backend of the application or reverse engineering the appâ€™s binary (code review).

# Our Penetration Testing Methodology

All our penetration tests are performed based on IT Security industry standards and our own frameworks.  
  
**Standards that we are using:** 

* [OWASP WSTG v4.2](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v42/)
* [OWASP MSTG v1.2](https://mobile-security.gitbook.io/mobile-security-testing-guide)
* [PTES](http://www.pentest-standard.org)  
  
While executing a penetration test following cyclic methodology is used to ensure quality and efficiency during an engagement.  
  
1. **Planning:** Before starting a penetration testing engagement we meet up with our client to setup goals, the scope and rules of the penetration test. Furthermore, a threat modeling of the application will be made to specify the engagement scope and assets to target.
2. **Discovery:** Through a security analysis, include scanning and initial enumeration of the target, potential security vulnerabilities are identified and preparations are made to exploit the target.
3. **Attack:** With the knowledge gained through the discovery phase attacks are planned and executed by the penetration tester against the target. Further enumeration of the target may lead to additional discovery phases. This phase's goal is to determine the impact of the found vulnerabilities.
3. **Reporting and Presenting:** The Penetration Tester will document all vulnerabilities, exploits executed and concludes everything into a written report for the prospect. This report includes remediation strategies to fix the found issues and recommendations to strengthen the weak points from a security perspective. All findings will be presented to the client in a final meeting.
4. **Retesting:** Continues retesting ensures that the application stays secure and found vulnerabilities got fixed properly. In this optional engagement the penetration tester focuses mainly on the previously found vulnerabilities. Retesting of the application can be defined in the planning phase or booked seperately.
